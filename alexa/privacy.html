<h1>Guardian Helper Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
The Guardian Helper skill can be used to manage a Destiny character's inventory via any
Amazon Alexa compatible device.
</p>
<p>
Guardian Helper does not store any user data, it simply uses the Bungie.net account
linked via the Alexa companion app to access a user's Destiny account.
</p>
<p>
To revoke account access from the Guardian Helper skill, just disable the skill
in the Alexa companion app.
</p>

<h2>Incorrect Item Translations</h2>
<p>
In order to improve the accuracy of item translations, Guardian Helper stores a list of items
that were translated by Alexa and could not be found in the Destiny item list. This list of words
will be used to create a better mapping of words heard by Alexa to in-game Destiny item names.
